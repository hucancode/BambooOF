# ofxOpenSteer #
Openframeworks lightweight wrapper for the opensource steering behaviors library [OpenSteer](http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/).

This addon was started by Philip Whitfield and extended by Paulo Barcelos.

This is quite an early stage so, for now, no instructions in here (the example app is quite easy to understand), but a few screen shots of the sample simulations:
